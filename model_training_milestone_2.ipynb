    "## 1. Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected during the post-earthquake field surveys conducted by the Nepal National Planning Commission and partners following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Trained enumerators visited the affected areas and collected information on the level of damage, structural characteristics (foundation, roof, building materials), household information, age, location information, and building use for over 250,000 buildings. The damage level for buildings is categorized from low damage to almost complete destruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was gotten from [drivendata](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/page/136/) as part of the Earthquake Modeling Damage Competition. The totality of the data is available through the [Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the data was provided in three seperate files:\n",
    " - train_values\n",
    " - train_labels\n",
    " - test_values \n",
    " \n",
    " The train_value files contains the feature describing each building, while train_labels provide the corresponding target variable, damage_grade, which indicates the level of structural damage.\n",
    "For this project, the train_values and the train_labels datasets were merged using the unique building identifier to form a single training dataset. The test_values file were not used since the target labels for it were not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the data was collected**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the primary goal of the survey was to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information which serves different uses including training ML tasks. After disasters, government and humanitarian organization usually need rapid and reliable estimates of building damage to prioritize emergency response, assess vulnerability to guide future preparedness and plan recovery operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Domain**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected as part of a national post-disaster assesment effort so it's aplication domain falls under disaster risk management, specifically post-disaster damage assessment. By understanding which features contribute most to level of damages, the project can provide insight useful for improving building construction in earthquake-prone areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning task to study**\n",
    "\n",
    "The target variable 'damage_grade' represents a discrete numerical value that indicates the level of damage to building. The damage_grade contains distinct values from 1-3. This problem is formulated as a multi-class classification task with the aim of predicting one of several damage grades for each building. \n"

This helped us visually identify any strong or weak correlation that could influence the model training.\n",

    "# 6. Proposed Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Data Spliting Strategy and Preventing Data Leakage**\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial dataset is splited into 80% for training and 20% for testing, following the standard Ml procedure. \n",
    "From our analysis, we see that the dataset is heavily imbalanced, therefore we chose stratified sampling method. To prevent data leakage and ensure good generalization on unseen data, we carefully design the data-splitting protocol. All preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables and applying Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) are performed only on the trainign set after splitting to avoid leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the features are highly imbalanced, we will focus on selecting models that is capable of dealing with this kind of problem and learning from the data efficiently.  The same transformations fitted on the training sets will be applied to the test sets to ensure consistency and to properly evaluate the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the data, we make an assumption that features (numerical: families_count, distribution of geolevel-2, distribution of geolevel-3, categorical: plan, position_configuration, legal_ownership_staus) has no direct relation to the Eathquake building damage classification problem. We verify this based on feature correlation with target variables heatmap. We will train two versions of the model: one excluding these features and another including them, to assess their impact on model performance and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, the binary features with the count of 1's less than 1% of the data, will also be examined.  Such features will be excluded if they show minimal contribution after model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Hyperparameters Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "For hyperparameter tuning, only the training data will be used—either by splitting it into training and validation subsets or by applying stratified k-fold cross-validation, depending on the model. The choice of tuning strategy will be made after selecting the model, as it depends on the number and complexity of parameters to be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Evaluation metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our task involves multi-class classification, we will use the macro F1 score as the primary evaluation metrics. The macro F1 score calculates the F1 score independently for each class and then takes the unweighted average, thus giving equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency in the dataset. This makes it particularly suitable for imbalanced datasets, where some classes may be underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the macro F1 score, we will also report the F1 score for each individual class. This will provide a more detailed view of the model’s performance across different categories and help identify specific classes where the model may be underperforming.\n"
